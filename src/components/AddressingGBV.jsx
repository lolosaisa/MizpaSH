        It is very crucial to Prevent and respond to GBV, as well as mitigate its risks across all sectors.
        It is our top priority at MIZPA to do that. We collaborate with partners, governments, and communities to implement effective programs aimed at preventing, reducing, and responding to GBV.

        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-neutral-500"> 
        Our primary goal is to protect the rights and well-being of women and young girls and others affected by GBV.
        It is our duty to protect individuals from GBV.
        In all our operations, we focus on two key objectives to tackle GBV:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>- Reducing the risk of GBV for all individuals of concern.</li>
          <li>- Ensuring that all GBV survivors have timely and adequate access to quality services that meet their needs.</li>

//GBV disproportionately affects women and girls, and their risk of exposure increases in situations of displacement. We are committed to continuously improving coordination and programming to safeguard women and girls from GBV. We advocate for sufficient resources to enhance the implementation of quality specialized programs for women and girls.

//We also support male survivors of sexual violence and those with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities (SOGI) through specialized programs designed to address their specific needs.
